Test engineers strive to catch defects before the product is released but they always creep in and they                often reappear, even with the best manual testing process
To avoid this, we developed a system which aimed at reducing human efforts and errors caused by manual  job inspection while  selecting the mechanical job. 
Here, we made use of a Deep Learning algorithm called CNN  for the job identification and using threshold operations the dimensions of the mechanical job were calculated which were later compared with the expected dimensions and thus identified whether the job is suitable for use or not.
As the object is compared with the pre-fed image it can scrutinize the object properly and thus giving us fruitful results such as shorter production time for products and also  a good quality product.
